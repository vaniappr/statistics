# A/B Testing

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted by a consumer lending company to evaluate the effectiveness of a new computer model designed to assist loan officers in reviewing applications. The aim is to reduce decision errors, particularly in minimizing loan defaults and maximizing approval of reliable applicants. Using experimental data collected over 10 days, we assessed the impact of the new model on error rates, confidence levels, and decision consistency.

**The Experiment**
- Control (the loan officers reviewed loan applications with the assistance of the current computer model)
- Treatment (the loan officers reviewed loan applications with the assistance of the new computer model).

The analysis includes statistical comparisons between control and treatment groups, with recommendations for whether the new model should be adopted, and whether the experiment should be extended or redesigned. All data processing and analysis were conducted in R, and the final report is presented in an HTML format.
