Examine customer satisfaction data from a furniture retail company. Each row represents one store. The data includes the average customer satisfaction score, the average staff job satisfaction score, the average delivery time of large and custom items, whether the store was carrying a new range of products, and the company’s categorisation of store type by local socio-economic-status (low, medium and high). The company is particularly interested in the effect of delivery times upon customer satisfaction, and whether the effect is the same across high, medium and low ‘’Socio-Economic-Status’’ (SES) stores.
