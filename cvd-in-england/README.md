This section uses data from various datasets from the UK Office for National Statistics. Each row of the data represents one local authority region. It contains data representing the percentage of people living in the area who have recently experienced Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), the proportion who are overweight, the proportion who meet the definition of living in poverty, the proportion who smoke, the average wellbeing score of people living in the area, and the total population living in each area. We are interested in identifying which of these factors (overweight, smokers, wellbeing, and poverty) affect the prevalence of CVD in an area.
